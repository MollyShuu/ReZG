#   Counter-Narrative (CN) classifier in ReZG

This repository contains the training code and weights for the Counter-Narrative (CN) classifier used in Paper ```"ReZG: Retrieval-Augmented Zero-Shot Counter Narrative Generation for Hate Speech"```, which is used to determine the effectiveness of counter-narratives against hate speech. 

- **The training code** of it is in the file ```Finetune Roberta for CN detection.pynb```
- **The weight** of it is strored in ```CNClassifier-ReZG.pt```, which can be obtained through: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c_iB2IgAiCyPCyviYucLPw?pwd=4q9x 

The training data is formalized as follows:

| index | target    | hs                                      | cn                                         | label |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1     | DISABLED | Folks with down syndrome are inferior.  | People with Down Syndrome are not inferior to anyone else.  Our genetic condition isn't something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others. | 1     |
| 2     | DISABLED      | Folks with down syndrome are inferior. | All religions have value and are welcome to our country. | 0  |


- `index`: A unique identifier for each instance.
- `target`: The target of the hate speech.
- `hs`: The content of the hate speech (HS).
- `cn`: The text provided to challenge the hate speech.
- `label`: A binary label indicating whether the `cn` is a valid counter-narrative for the corresponding `hs`:
  - `1`: The `cn` is a valid counter-narrative for the `hs`.
  - `0`: The `cn` is not a valid counter-narrative for the `hs`.
